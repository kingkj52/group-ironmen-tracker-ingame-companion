/**
 * Detects whether the official Group Ironmen Tracker plugin is installed and running.
 * <p>
 * When it is, this plugin stays purely a reader: the tracker owns uploading and we would
 * only duplicate its traffic. When it is not, our own uploader takes over so the plugin
 * works standalone.
 * <p>
 * The check compares plugin class names, which is plain {@code Object.getClass()} and not
 * reflection: nothing is loaded, invoked or made accessible.
 * <p>
 * The answer is cached briefly because it is consulted several times per game tick and
 * scanning the whole plugin list that often is wasteful. The window is short enough that
 * enabling or disabling the tracker plugin takes effect almost immediately.
