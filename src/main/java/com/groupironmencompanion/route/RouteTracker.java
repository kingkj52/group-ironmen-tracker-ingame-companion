/**
 * Keeps a Shortest Path route pointed at a moving group member.
 * <p>
 * The target is stored as a member name rather than a fixed point, so as their position
 * updates the route is re-issued to follow them. It is retargeted only when they have
 * actually moved a meaningful distance, because re-pathing costs a search and their
 * coordinates jitter by a tile as they walk.
 * <p>
 * Arrival is judged against the member's <em>true</em> position, including plane, not the
 * surface entrance drawn on the overworld map: following someone into a dungeon should not
 * count as done the moment you reach the ladder.
